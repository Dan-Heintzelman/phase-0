// Part 1 - User Story


// 1. As a user, I want to have a function called sum(oddLengthArray).
//   I want it to add up the value all of the odd valued items in my list. It
//   shouldn't count any of the numbers with an even value in this list.

// 2. I want to have a function called sum(evenLengthArray).
//   I want it to add up the value all of the even valued items in my list. It shouldn
//   't count any of the numbers with an odd value in this list.

// 3. I want to have another function called mean. This takes the
//   starting list (oddLengthArray). This function should average the value of all
//   the items in that list that have an odd value.

// 4. I want to have another function called mean. This takes the
//   starting list (evenLengthArray). This function should average the value of all
//   the items in that list that have an even value.

// 5. I want to make another function called median, that
//   will give me the mean of all of the odd items in the oddLengthArray list.

// 6. Finally, there should be another median function that gives me the same result
//   as step 5, but on the evenLengthArray list.
