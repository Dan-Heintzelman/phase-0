  Reflection:
  1.What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

  It is always a little bit awkward translating a graphical site into skeleton HTML because you always have the tendancy to want to use HTML to style instead of provide semantic stucture and meaning to your document. I have a bit of HTML experience, so it was difficult for me interpreting what the assignment wanted us to do. For this reason, we tried to keep it very simple.

  2.How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  For this assignment, we kept the HTML pretty bare bones. Since this website was not very complex, we did not break out the site using html5 dividing elements. <header>,<main>,<section>,<article>, <footer>, etc. I did however break the list out into two unordered lists since from the look of the website, this is most likely two separate sections.

  3.How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

  The only element we used that could be described as a formatting element would be the <hr> (horizontal rule) element. I used it in order to best clone the image shown in our assignment, even though this is not used often in modern HTML. I commented this out in the HTML since I do not believe it best practive.

  4.What seems good and bad about HTML?

  What's good about HTML is that it is a very powerful markup language for giving semantic meaning and structure to documents. What is bad about HTML is that it can easily become very repetive and boring. Another bad thing about HTML is that there is a lot of "bad" HTML out there that is poorly written. As a web developer, you have to deal with a lot of bad HTML out there that is not written to new standards. Of course, this can be said likely for many languages.

  5.What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

   The best trick one can use is likely to know how to both research and test your code so you don't have to remember everything. There are many good HTML resources includes html5doctor, where you can easily look up HTML elements and attributes. Also, when you are done writing it, find a good HTML validator to check your code. My best "trick" for remembering off the top of your head is not really a trick at all. The best thing to do is to try to write it all out yourself instead of using autocomplete to fill in closing tags. In JSFiddle, we turned off autocomplete in the settings menu at the top right.
