#4 Reflection

1. What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

  I really enjoyed this challenge because I actually feel like this code is useful in the real
  world. It made me feel like I was writing something that I could use in the future, but It
  also made it easier to conceptualize my inputs and outputs. The most challenging part of this
  challenge was figuring out what to do with the leftover cohort-mates. I took me a few minutes
  to determine how to add them back into the array.

2. Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

  I think I am always improving my abilty to write pseudocode. This probably has to do with the
  fact that I was so bad at it originally!

3. Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

  I think my approach was good! I like the fact that this code doesn't just work for the supplied
  inputs, this would work for any cohort that requires groups 5 or less. Unfortunately, it will not
  create a group of 3, but I don't see why this would need to be done.

4. What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

  I decided to store the accountability groups in a hash because from the beginning I knew that I
  was going to use want the key to be the group number. I supposed I could have used and array,
  but I think using a Hash allows for more flexibility in the future.

5. What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

  I liked my initial solution quite a bit. In my refactoring I essentially cleaned up the code a bit.
  I had one line of code that was uncesssary that I forgot to remove. I also used string interpolation
  as an alternate way to print my output. I did not learn any new ruby methods in the refactor this
  time around.
